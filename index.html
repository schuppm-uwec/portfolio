    <h3>Education</h3>
    <img src="images/eau-claire.png" alt="UW-Eau Claire logo">
    <p>
        I am currently studying at UW-Eau Claire as a third
        year student. My major is Computer Science. I am planning
        to graduate in Spring 2024.
    </p>
    <br>
    <br>
    <p>
      For my third year, I am enrolled in Fundamentals of Web Page Design and Web Systems. 
      Previously, I have taken classes such as Database Systems, Computer 
      Architecture, Operating Systems, and Programming Languages.

    <h3>My Goals</h3>
    <p>
        Having Computer Science be my major, I have a passion
        for many different development fields. I am always
        seeking the challenge of solving complex problems,
        even if they fly right over my head. The fields that
        I am most interested in would be Game Development,
        Website Development, and Cyber Security. As far as
        my goals in life go, I want to be in an environment
        where I am comfortable yet constantly learning new
        techniques. A place with an infinite amount of design
        space and creativity, that can hopefully inspire
        me and challenge me throughout my life.
